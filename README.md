# SeansLifeArchive_Images_GNOME_System_Monitor_Dump-Unprocessed

## What is this?

This is a repository for hosting my GNOME System Monitor screenshots from the year 2022 and above, for use of renaming, and adding to their intended repository.

## Why?

In late 2022, I became incapable of keeping up with naming image files, and in early 2023, I came up with the solution of creating "unprocessed" repositories, so that they can be named and exported to their target. This task shouldn't be done manually to begin with.

## Unprocessed dump?

Unprocessed in this context just means it is not named or organized. The dump part is because images are dumped here. I know it sounds dirty, but it is a completely innocent process.

## Who is going to do it?

I am not sure yet. I feel it can be a test of my new [:octocat: AI (AI2001)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001/) as a warmup exercise for telling the difference between image files. There will also be additional review required.

## Target

The üéØÔ∏è target repository for these images is [:octocat: `/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GNOME_System_Monitor`](https://https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GNOME_System_Monitor/)
